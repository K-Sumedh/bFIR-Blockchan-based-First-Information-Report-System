<p style="margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em; text-align: center;">India is experiencing a sharp rise in criminal activity. These activities are
    frequently not reported. Even though there is an online platform for the po-
    lice to store FIRs and NCRs, the majority of FIRs are still written by hand
    as is the custom. The complainant must typically be present at the police sta-
    tion to report a cognizable offence. In 2009, the Crime and Criminal Tracking
    Network and Systems (CCTNS) for the entire nation was launched as an ef-
    ficient e-governance system. It is, however, a centralised system for a specific
    state.Therefore, a fully decentralised system is required to ensure that there
    is no single point of failure and that complaints are handled safely and se-
    curely to prevent unauthorised access. In this work our goal is to develop a
    blockchain-based solution to manage complaints against both cognizable and
    non-cognizable offences. Users, Police personnel will be authenticated for their
    roles using AuthBlock, a blockchain based authentication framework which is
    proposed in this work. The policeâ€™s FIR will be hashed, encrypted, and stored
    in IPFS before being posted to the blockchain network. Geth is used to create
    a local blockchain network.The complaint along with its timestamp is kept on
    the blockchain network, so if the police refuse to file the FIR as a result of pres-
    sure or claim they never received the complaint, the complainant will have good
    evidence against them. The possibility of the FIR/NCR being tampered with
    and being unreported would be eliminated by having all the entries saved in an
    immutable database.
